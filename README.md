To use this repository, clone the repo into your local computer and then split a new terminal. In one terminal, stay in the root directory and run npm install. In the second terminal, cd to the client folder and run npm install. After all the dependencies have been installed on your remote repository, run node server in the root directory and run npm start in the client folder directory to run the frontend. 

** Due to family emergencies, I was unable to add testing to the application and I commited whatever changes I had to this repository **
